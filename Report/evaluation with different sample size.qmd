# Simulation set up

A single optimal cut-off point was identified using the Youden method within a Bayesian classification framework, applied to a bivariate mixture model of CSF and plasma. For each sample size, the average cut-off point, the maximum of sensitivity + specificity, accuracy, area under the ROC curve (AUC), and prevalence were calculated across 1,000 datasets. However, it remains unclear why the maximum of sensitivity + specificity, accuracy, and AUC values decrease as the sample size increases.


$$
f\binom{y^{\text {csf }}}{y^{\text {plasma }}}=\sum_{k=1}^K \pi_k \cdot N\left(
\begin{array}{l}
\mu_{k}^\text{CSF} \\
\mu_{k}^\text{Plasma}
\end{array},
\Sigma
\right) 
$$
$$
\\ \text { where } \mu_k^{\text {csf }}=(0.05,0.1), \mu_k^{\text {plasma }}=(0.08,0.1), \Sigma=\left(\begin{array}{ll}
0.0001082 & 0.0000375 \\
0.0000375 & 0.0001030
\end{array}\right)

## Findings
A single optimal cut-off point was identified using the Youden method within a Bayesian framework classification, applied to a bivariate mixture model of CSF and plasma. For each sample size, the average cut-off point, maximum of sensitivity + specificity, accuracy, area under the ROC curve (AUC), and prevalence were calculated across 1,000 datasets. However, I have yet to resolve why the maximum of sensitivity + specificity, accuracy, and AUC values decrease as the sample size increases.
