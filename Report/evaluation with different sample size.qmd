# Simulation set up

To determine the required sample size for estimating reliable cut points in CSF and Plasma, simulations were conducted using a bivariate mixture model. The model was run with varying sample sizes for CSF and Plasma to assess the impact of sample size on the accuracy of cut point estimation.

$$
f\binom{y^{\text {csf }}}{y^{\text {plasma }}}=\sum_{k=1}^K \pi_k \cdot N\left(
\begin{array}{l}
\mu_{k}^\text{CSF} \\
\mu_{k}^\text{Plasma}
\end{array},
\Sigma
\right) 
$$
$$
\\ \text { where } \mu_k^{\text {csf }}=(0.05,0.1), \mu_k^{\text {plasma }}=(0.08,0.1), \Sigma=\left(\begin{array}{ll}
0.0001082 & 0.0000375 \\
0.0000375 & 0.0001030
\end{array}\right)
$$
