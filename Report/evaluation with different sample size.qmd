# Simulation set up

A single optimal cut-off point was identified using the Youden method within a Bayesian classification framework, applied to a bivariate mixture model of CSF and plasma. The amyloid positive was define as z > 0.5. Subject was label as amyloid positive when k = 2. 


$$
f\binom{y^{\text {csf }}}{y^{\text {plasma }}}=\sum_{k=1}^2 \pi_k \cdot N\left(
\begin{array}{l}
\mu_{k}
\end{array},
\Sigma
\right) 
$$
$$
\\ \text { where } \mu_\text{1}=(0.05,0.08), \mu_\text{2}=(0.1,0.1), \Sigma=\left(\begin{array}{ll}
0.0001082 & 0.0000375 \\
0.0000375 & 0.0001030
\end{array}\right), \pi_1 = 0.3, \pi_2 = 0.7
$$




## Findings
A single optimal cut-off point was identified using the Youden method within a Bayesian framework classification, applied to a bivariate mixture model of CSF and plasma. Youden method select the cut-point maximizing Youden's J statistic which is sensitivity + specificity -1. For each sample size, the average cut-off point, sensitivity, specificity, accuracy were calculated across 1,000 datasets. However, I have yet to resolve why the sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and AUC values decrease as the sample size increases.
